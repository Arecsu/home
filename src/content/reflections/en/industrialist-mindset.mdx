Our education system was built for [factories and conformity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc) — rows of desks, standardized exams to test your compliance, raising your hand for permission to speak, and uniform curricula for all students.

They trained us to be obedient workers. To memorize and repeat. To fear stepping out of line. By instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing time according to the ringing of a bell, they prepared students for future employment.

We do not need this anymore.

The internet broke these chains. Knowledge stopped being a privilege and became free: information everywhere, communities of makers, entire universities' worth of content at your fingertips, and access to the best worldwide teachers in highly specific subjects, from pretty much anywhere at incredible speed.

A few saw this and soared, following their curiosity down endless rabbit holes of learning, building things just because they could. They didn’t wait for permission. They just started.

But many are still trapped in the industrialist mindset. Here’s the truth: We’ve run out of space for people with a 20th century mentality.

Today’s problems demand new ideas and imagination — qualities impossible to nurture with the rigid, repetitive nature of the industrialist mindset. Obedience doesn’t solve problems anymore. Creativity does.

The great news is that the tools for self-empowerment have been here for years, and they keep evolving. We have decades of accumulated human knowledge easily available, and now even AI to help us explore and build upon those foundations. The distance between "I want to" and "I can" has never been smaller. The last excuses are crumbling.

The only question that matters is: *What do you want?* What do you yearn to build, to learn, to become? Stop hiding behind “I don’t know how.” Start with “I want to,” and let your curiosity lead the way.

Go ahead and do something cool. There are no excuses.
