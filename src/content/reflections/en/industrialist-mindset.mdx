Our education system was built for [factories and conformity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc) — rows of desks, standardized exams to test your compliance, raising your hand for permission to speak, and uniform curricula for all students.

They trained us to be obedient workers. To memorize and regurgitate. To fear stepping out of line. By instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing time according to the ringing of a bell, they prepared students for future employment.

We do not need this anymore.

The internet shattered these chains years ago. Knowledge stopped being a carefully guarded treasure and became a flood: free information, communities of makers, entire universities' worth of content at your fingertips, and access to the best worldwide teachers in highly specific subjects, from pretty much anywhere at incredible speed.

A few saw this and soared, following their curiosity down endless rabbit holes of learning, building things just because they could. They didn’t wait for permission or credentials. They just did.

On the other hand, many are still trapped in the industrialist mindset. Here's the thing: What you know no longer defines what you can do. What you want to do defines what you can do.

The tools for self–empowerment have been here for years, and they keep evolving.

Now we have AI that can fill our knowledge gaps in extraordinary ways. It can helps us turn half-formed ideas into reality. It can bridge the gap between “I want to” and “I can.” The last excuses are crumbling. And we’re just barely scratching the surface.

The only question that matters is: *What do you want?* What do you yearn to build, to learn, to become? Stop hiding behind “I don’t know how.” Start with “I want to,” and let your curiosity lead the way.

The tools are here. There are no excuses.
