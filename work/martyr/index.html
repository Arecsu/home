<!DOCTYPE html><script type="module" src="/www/_astro/page.D3gCUAtq.js"></script><p>Conceived as an exercise of self-discovery, martyr⁠— evolved into a digital art supply store with strong focus on experimental, avant-garde graphical assets for artists willing to push the boundaries of today’s visual language. Settled as a UK company, with roots in Argentina.</p>
<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>I’m a curious human by nature. I’ve always loved to learn about the word around me. When I want to make something, I embarc into a journey.</p>
<p>With that framework, I’ve developed a fascination for computers and systems. It sparked as early as 3 years old.</p>
<p>Related to my deep interest in “things that move magically in a screen with the press of a button”, I expanded my horizons in highly technical fields at high school. I learned the craft of being a machinist, and gathered knowledge from the broader field of manufacturing and engineering.</p>
<p>At 18, I decided to completely turn the tables: the next journey would be into the art world. There was this latent delight for beautiful, balanced, meaningful artworks. While music never ceased to move my emotions in a profound way, the visual language felt like home to me personally. To explore my own ideas and help other people express theirs became my primary ambition.</p>
<p>Previously, I had worked on different projects, mainly portrait photo and video work, particularly in the music and fashion scene.</p>
<h3 id="engineering--arts">Engineering &#x3C;—> Arts</h3>
<p>For the previous stated reason, there is this tangible connection between cutting edge technology and artistic expression in the assets martyr— produces.</p>
<p>Art is having something to say with honest intention. The engineering part helps this voice to be spoken with clarity.</p>
<p>There, we approach <a href="https://calnewport.com/approach-technology-like-the-amish/">the use of technology like the Amish do</a>: a new process or technology will be adopted as long as it serves our values and purposes. If it doesn’t, we discard it and continue working with what we have.</p>
<p>Simplicity and limitations breeds creativity and outstanding results. In our increasingly tech trend-driven world, we recognize the potential and attractiveness new tools might bring. But more often than not, they fail to elevate the quality of the process and, even worse, they result in worryingly addictive distraction from what it matters.</p>
<p>Amateurs obsess over tools. Pros over mastery.</p>
<h3 id="details_matter">details_matter</h3>
<p>If you observe the world around us, the beautiful things we enjoy and get inspiration from are filled with details. Even an empty wall. Have you tried to create a clean, smooth wall with the edges so straight and aligned to a squared grid? There is a lot going on in the process. It is not easy.</p>
<p>The details are often a product of the effort been put to achieve a specific purpose. Anything with purpose expects details. In the case of the wall, any imperfection such as a curved line along the edges or visible stroke brushes will fail to meet the purpose of a clean, minimal, geometrical wall.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, perfection is the enemy of good enough. Balance is key. Not perfect, but with enough reasonable dedication. The final work should speak for itself.</p>
<p>There will be times where the concept was flawed from the beginning. No matter how detailed it is, it won’t matter. That’s fine. Sometimes we have to take one step backward to take two steps forward.</p>
<p>The assets we create at martyr— are, usually, created using in-house crafted techniques to achieve their look and feel. From beginning to end. While a good portion of the techniques comes from previous experience, new ones arises in the process. The inners and hows are very specific. However, this is the key: as long as the intention to make something remarkable exists, we will keep finding ways to achieve it. It is just a matter of time and love to the craft.</p>
<h3 id="straight-edge">Straight Edge</h3>
<p>Inspiration happens when you pay attention. To pay attention is to have a clear mind. To have a clear mind is to take care of yourself and your surroundings.</p>
<p>A stoic life without excesses and time to be contemplative is required. Realize the day to day experience is often mundane, and strikes with the unexpected in different ways.</p>
<p>martyr— does not embrace shortcuts. Work is hard. Things do take effort and time. But it shouldn’t feel dreadful to embrace the process. In fact, it should feel meaningful. Otherwise, it won’t make sense.</p>
<h3 id="thanks">(THANKS)</h3>
<p>There are plans to transform martyr— and incorporate inspiring creative minds to keep creating.</p>
<p>By now, martyr— has been and it is still run only by me. That does not mean I didn’t receive help and support from other human beings along the way.</p>
<p>To those that came to mind: Eric, Ahmad, Madina, Marco, Antoine, Sol, my family, Luciana, and mom.</p>
